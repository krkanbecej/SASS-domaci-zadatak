 <h3>Clean layout</h3> 
<p>Don’t fill your page up with ‘stuff’. White space is good – it enhances the look of your site. Try to keep your content as the focus of your site. Use fonts that will be available on all computers so your page doesn’t end up looking messy.</p>

<p>The way you organise your content, is as important as what your page looks like, so spend some time on it. If your readers can’t find what they are looking for, they’ll just go look someplace else.</p>

<p>Make sure your text is big enough to read. I know, you’re probably thinking ‘thank you captain obvious.’ Well, I hate to state the obvious, but I am amazed at the number of sites I go to that I have to squint to read. Please, don’t punish me for actually wanting to read your content.</p>

<h4>Identity</h4>
<p>Ensure your site has a brand identity that reflects your brand values. Try to avoid cliche stock imagery.</p>

 <h4>Contrast</h4>
